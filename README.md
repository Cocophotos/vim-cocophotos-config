# Description

Vim config used for programming notably in:

- TypeScript
- CSS
- HTML
- VueJS
- Python
- Scala (soon)
- C/C++ (soon)

# Installation

You need a fairly recent version of [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim) (0.3.x) to work. It is possible to make it work on Vim 8+ but it is not supported as is.


Just move the .vimrc into your $HOME and create the .vim directory

```bash
#Create the .vim directory
mkdir $HOME/.vim

#Move the config file .vimrc
# WARNING : this may erase an old .vimrc 
mv .vimrc $HOME/.vimrc
```

Then, you need to install [VimPlug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```bash
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

This being done, you can install all the plugins (bundles).

# Bundles installation

## Basic install

To install the new bundle, open a terminal and type:

```bash
vim +PlugInstall
```

When complete, just type *:q* in Normal Mode to exit Vim.

## CocConfig and CocInstall

### Prerequisites

You should read the documentation of [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim), but you need at least the latest LTS of Node.js (8.11.x) to make it work.

### Install language servers

Then, you need to install the Language Servers for coc.nvim. Start vim and run the 
command:

```bash
:CocInstall coc-json coc-css coc-html coc-tsserver coc-tslint-plugin coc-ultisnips coc-python coc-vetur
```

This will install the language servers for:

- JSON
- CSS
- HTML
- TypeScript (+ the linting plugin)
- Ultisnips (for snippets)
- Python
- VueJS (with vetur)

You can choose which language servers you want to install, but we always recommend:

- JSON
- Ultisnips

### Install custom language servers

Some language servers need to be installed separately:

- [digestif](https://github.com/astoff/digestif) for LaTeX
- [flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) for Flow typing in JavaScript

Our coc-config provides the right configuration for those languager servers. 

### Copy/Paste coc-config

Open vim and execute the command:

```bash
:CocConfig
```

Then copy/paste the coc-settings.json content from this repository

# Bundles description

## Theming

We use Gruvbox as the default theme. It is free, has good constrast, we love it.

## General purpose bundles

- [NerdTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdTree): Tree file explorer. Use Ctrl+n to open the explorer
- [YankRing](https://github.com/vim-scripts/YankRing.vim): Circular buffer for copy/pasting
- [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround): Allow to change surrounding around text (parentheses, brackets, ...)
- [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim): Ctrlp is the most efficient and easy way to open buffers & files on Vim. With the stroke of <C-p> binding you can easily search through all the different files available in the PWD and the best part is that you donâ€™t even have to be precise while typing the name of the file or buffer.
- [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion): Easy motion makes the process of moving around the lines in a document or piece of code much simpler by adding shortcuts to access different parts of the visible lines.
- [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline): The famous status tabline for Vim
- [delimitMate](https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate): provides automatic closing of quotes, parenthesis, brackets, etc.
- [gundo](https://github.com/sjl/gundo.vim): Gundo.vim is the Vim plugin to visualize your Vim undo tree.
- [rainbow_parentheses](https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim): Coloring parentheses (brackets, ...) when they are mingled
- [tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular): Allow fast tabularization of input

## Text object bundles

We have several text object plugins to help text blocks selection and formatting. Also, we have those plugins:

- [vim-expande-region](https://github.com/terryma/vim-expand-region): Expanding selection by pressing `+` (or `_` to shrink).

## Development

Apart from coc.nvim, we have support for:

- C++11 (syntax highlighting)
- Shell Fish (syntax)
- VueJs (syntax hightlighting)
- CMake support
- PEP8 indentation for Python
- TypeScript/JavaScript (syntax hightlighting)

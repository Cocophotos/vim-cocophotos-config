Just move the directory and the .vimrc into your $HOME

```bash
#Move the .vim directory
# WARNING : this may erase an old .vim directory
mv .vim $HOME/.vim

#Move the config file .vimrc
# WARNING : this may erase an old .vimrc

# Bundles installation

## Basic install

To install the new bundle, open a terminal and type:

```bash
vim +BundleInstall
```

When complete, just type *:q* in Normal Mode to exit Vim.

## YouCompleteMe install

You need to compile YouCompleteMe yourself. To do so, go to the YouComplete subdirectory

```bash
cd $HOME/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
```

Then you can compile it with

```bash
./install.sh
```

If you want the C++ semantic completer support, use:

```bash
./install.sh --clang-completer
```

Please refer to the YouCompleteMe documentation for more information (https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
